								<p>A Learning Project: Twitter Airline Sentiment Analysis and prediction Application, airline sentiment dataset from kaggle.</p>
								The methods used along to analyse and predict the sentiment is as follows:</br>
								- <b>Text Preprocessing</b>: Utilized neattext NLP functions for data cleaning, including removing special characters, stopwords, and performing lemmatization to normalize words.</br>
								- <b>Feature Engineering</b>: Converted text into machine-readable formats using One-Hot Encoding (CountVectorizer - Bag of Words) and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec).</br>
								- <b>Handling Imbalanced Data</b>: Checked class distribution and applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.</br>
								- <b>Dimensionality Reduction & Model Selection</b>: Performed PCA for visualization and selected the best-fit model.</br>
								- <b>Model Implementation</b>: Implemented and compared multiple models, including Random Forest, SVC, and Multinomial Naïve Bayes, with Naïve Bayes performing optimally.</br>
								- <b>Neural Network Optimization</b>: Used a GRU-based approach to extract key features, flatten input vectors, and feed them into dense layers for improved accuracy.</br>
